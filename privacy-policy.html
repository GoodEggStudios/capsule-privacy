  <p><strong>System Log Data</strong></p>
  <p>We do not use any external libraries to collect device and personal data in the likely event of a crash. Apple and
    Google provide services through their Apple App Store and Google Play Store. You may be asked to provide this data
    in the unfortunate event of their being a crash, however none of this data is stored on Good Egg Studios servers.
    Because we do not track these events through our application directly. If you encounter any problems please contact

    our systems that provide data to the application. The one exception being when you choose to play items within the
    application. These files can be served from servers that only support HTTP.</p>
